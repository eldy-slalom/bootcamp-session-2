# Implementation Plan - TODO App Enhancement

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the roadmap for transforming the current basic TODO app into a fully-featured task management application that adheres to all project guidelines including functional requirements, UI standards, testing practices, and coding principles.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **Frontend**: Basic React app with simple item list functionality
- **Backend**: Express.js API with in-memory SQLite database
- **Features**: Basic CRUD operations for generic items
- **Database**: Simple `items` table with id, name, and created_at fields

### Gaps to Address
- No task-specific features (completion status, due dates, priority)
- Missing Material-UI components and design system
- No accessibility features
- Limited error handling and validation
- No comprehensive test coverage
- Missing task management features outlined in functional requirements

## Implementation Phases
